MetaPavo gets its name from a species of peacock that lives in Southeast and South Asia and comes in blue and green colors.&#x20;

The image of Pavo implies a way to organize Web3 information, and attach information to the main nodes in the information network through two core means of layering and classification. Ultimately, this approach results in a single entry, information management solution that carries unlimited information, while being clear and effective. MetaPavo's core competencies embody this moral everywhere.

### The implementation mechanism of MetaPavo

Here we analyze the core mechanisms of these mechanisms: information search, information identification, security identification, and workbench.

### 1. information search

Information search is one of the core functions of MetaPavo. Its implementation mechanism is to inject the search component into all pages through the chrome plug-in mechanism, so that users can invoke the search component at any time on any page to search. Behind the search is a simple search engine, and its search results are obtained from the API of each platform. We classify and mark various types of information in the data service to provide users with classified search results.

### 2. information identification

Similarly, information identification also injects information identification components into all pages through the chrome plug-in mechanism. When you browse a specific website, we will scan the specific content on the page locally, and then identify it according to the subject classification, such as NFTs, Tokens, DAPPs, KOLS, Articles, Premints, DAOs, Companies and other information, once the identification is successful , we will obtain their detailed information, expand the information identification component, and display the information in the information identification component.

### 3. security identification

In the process of browsing twitter or other websites, we will scan and identify dangerous content on the page, such as phishing websites, malicious websites, fake twitter accounts, etc. Once the identification is successful, we will remind users in an obvious way.

### 4. workbench

The workbench uses the new tabs function of the chrome plug-in to override the default new page of the browser. Every time you open a new blank tab, the MetaPavo workbench interface will be opened by default. On this page, you can search, view favorite information, adjust the position and visibility of modules, etc., and customize your own workbenchã€‚

### The Future of MetaPavo

The future of MetaPavo is a super search engine + content interactive community + personal information assistant

### 1. Personal information assistant

Through the evolution of product form and the introduction of more information content, we will provide users with more convenient, anytime, anywhere, and smarter information services, such as personal workbenches on mobile terminals, and make more in-depth connections with other platforms.

### 2. Super search engine

MetaPavo's search engine will support the access of more platform data, support the access of more types of data, introduce more intelligent search algorithms, and provide users with more accurate search results.

### 3. Content Interactive Community

MetaPavo will encourage users to conduct decentralized evaluation, recommendation, and collection of information, dig out valuable information in real time, and reach users who need this information, forming a benign closed loop of information value.
